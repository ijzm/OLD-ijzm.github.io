Hi everyone!

I have been trying to create games since a long time ago... As some of you may know. But... 
What is not leting me make them?

Simple question, hard answer:

When I first started programming, was at the age of 12, with very little knowledge. I was using my school library's computers. In there, I used Adobe Flash CS3, and actionscript 2.0 to create my first prototypes.
I wont go too long of what I did with those, they were just simple stuff that let me create code.
Then... I met some awesome guys on the Internet, and we tryed to create some games, the first that comes to mind is one called Cat Dropped.
At that time, because of my very poor knowledge on programming, the thing that didn't let me create games was basically my knowledge.

Fast forward some years, age is 2015. It's summer, and as always, I am bored. I start wondering around some older files, and find the Cat Dropped file.
I open it... and I must say... I was pretty Disgusted of myself. The code was poor quality, and really horrible to read. It took some work, and after just 3 days I managed to complete a version of Cat Dropped which I was proud.

Great, I had created my game. I wanted people to see it, I wanted some feedback. But I couldn't publish it. The guy that made all the sprites, and had the idea of the game was long gone. I sent him lots of messages, on all the websites I could find, but months passed and still no answer.

So I kept going, change the IDE I used, migrated from Actionscript 2.0 to HTML5. Some stuff were familiar, and I could go and create some simple stuff.

It was learning everything all over. But it was javascript, almost the same as I used in flash, so it was way easier than starting from scratch.

I managed to make some simple tests, just to check how did the language work and some stuff... and after some time... I decided to make a game.

The game, as you cam probably see it on the main page, has a temporary name: "The Binding Of Ignacio", this is because, the movement and stuff are familiar from "The Binding of Isaac", but i wanted to change some mechanics.

Now... the engine of the game is almost over... But now... my creativity is letting me behind. I tried putting up a simple story, and failed, I didnt like it.

I also tryied to make sprites, but I also sucked at it. Finally, another friend helped me make some basic sprites.

But now... What? I have a game engine finished. I have some sprites? Why dont I finish the game?

Because.. creativity.. I cant simply get to make a story I like...

I hope one day I complete all the projects i have laying around on my pc, but until now...

Stay Updated!
